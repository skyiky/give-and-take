# Give & Take

Hack for Humanity 2018 Hackathon Project

A web application developed with Node.js, Express, Google Maps API, Angular and Bootstrap.

Give & Take is a website built with the purpose of giving people in need a way to request basic needs and supplies from other people. People can view services and resources that people are offering through our Google Maps API. If people wish to donate/offer supplies, They must sign up and create an account. Once they create their account they will be allowed to make as many offer postings as they want. These postings will then be viewable by all other users of the website. If someone wishes to request supplies, they will be able to message the posting creator directly through the in-app messaging functionality.
