# Give & Take

Hack for Humanity 2018 Hackathon Project

# What does it do?

Essentialy, Give & Take is a website built with the purpose of giving people in need a way to request basic needs and supplies from other people. 

People can view services and resources that people are offering through our Google Maps API. If people wish to donate/offer supplies, They must sign up and create an account. Once they create their account they will be allowed to make as many offer postings as they want. These postings will then be viewable by all other users of the website. If someone wishes to request supplies, they will be able to message the posting creator directly through the in-app messaging functionality.

# What problem does it solve?

The underlying problem that Give & Take is trying to tackle is how difficult it can be for people in need to receive the supplies they need. In contrast to government funded food-banks and shelther, Give & Take attempts to get the community more involved in helping those in need. Give & Take may also be useful for emergency situations where people may need to seek nearby refuge or shelter.

# What is your stack?

Give & Take is a web application developed with Node.js, Express, Google Maps API, Angular and Bootstrap.

# What was the most difficult part?

The most difficult parts were integrating our site with Google Maps API and creating our Front-end interfaces

# What are the next steps?

Some furthers steps that we considered were adding mobile support, an in-site "karma" system where givers and takers could be rated for how often they contribute or take. Scalability fixes.
